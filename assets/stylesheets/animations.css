/* ANIMATIONS */

/* To create animations purely with CSS we can use the keyframe rule.
 * The key frame rule is where the animation is specified. Here is an
 * example of an animation that scales an element from one tenth of 
 * its original size to full size. For best browser
 * compatability you should try to always specify a from and to rule,
 * even if the value could be implicit, as it is in the case of our
 * to value here...
 *
 */

@keyframes myfirst {
from {transform: scale(0.1,0.1);}
to {transform: scale(1, 1);}
}

@-webkit-keyframes myfirst /* Safari and Chrome */ {
from {-webkit-transform: scale(0.1,0.1);}
to {-webkit-transform: scale(1,1)}
}

/* In order for he animation to fire it must be bound to a selector. 
 * Here we will bind it to our .animate class.
 *

.animate {
  animation: myfirst 5s;
